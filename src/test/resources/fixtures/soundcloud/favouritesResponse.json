    "description": "Sweden, and of safe, inoffensive cars, safe, inoffensive furniture and at-least-relatively-inoffensive vodka changes its game when it comes to music. Punching above its weight in every conceivable way for the past few decades, the country that brought us Abba has long been one of the leading lights of all things electronic for while now. At the forefront of this global takeover fast rising starlet Adeline who has been impressing those in the know with both her work in the studio and the DJ booth for the past few years.\n\nBrought up in the rolling Swedish countryside, it wasn't long before Adeline made her way to Stockholm and became an integral part of the city's vibrant underground music scene. Recent years have seen her stock continue to soar with an increasingly hectic tour schedule seeing her spend extensive periods in New York, Milan, Berlin, London and Ibiza before most recently setting up shop in Barcelona.\n\nSo with a big 2016 ahead of her we thought the time was right to welcome back the little lady with the big personality to Data Transmission. It's been over two years since she served up a particularly memorable edition of the DT podcast and we're pleased to report that she's lost none of her skill or dexterity on the decks in the meantime. So sit back, relax and let Adeline spirit you away to a place where the weather's warm, the drinks are cold and the club never closes...\n",

    "description": "Talented and original we welcome Swedish electronic starlet Adeline to helm this weeks podcast. Having been brought up amongst idyllic Swedish countryside, Adeline swiftly made her way more urbane climbs as she moved to Stockholm and the, embraced the pioneering underground concept that the Stockholm club scene has to offer. She then quickly rose to prominence with the Swedish scene and soon found herself Scandinavia biggest electronic radio show P3 Dans as well as helping in the set up of the then newly formed SoundCloud. \r\n\r\nThen arriving in London in 2010 via a Milan, New York and Berlin Adeline continue to refine her own distinct sound characterized by hypnotizing chords and warbling basslines over slick melodies that tie together for tracks that stand out in even the strongest of sets. Gaining support from some of the scenes coolest names from Damien Lazarus to David August,  releasing on some of the hottest labels in Kindisch and Cuprit and gaining rave reviews from performance across Europe for her performances the future looks very bright for Adeline.  Delivering and eclectic and interesting set for us this week we think it’s a firm statement of intent for the summer to come! Enjoy.",
